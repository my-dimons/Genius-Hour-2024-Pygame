Description
=
For my genius hour I learned how to use [Github]([url](https://github.com/)) and how to code in python using an extension called [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/about). I spent the begining of this genuis hour just learning the basics ([Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO6qQDNa2UY)). I made 3 main games and a few behind the scene games, all these games total to over 1000 lines of code.

([**Driving Sim**](https://github.com/my-dimons/Genius-Hour-2024-Pygame/tree/main/games/driving-simulator)) After learning the basics I started to make a simple driving simulator. This game was a bit of a challenge because at the start, as it was my first game, but in the end I think it turned out well. This script is at almost 200 lines of code currently.

([**Button Gambling**](https://github.com/my-dimons/Genius-Hour-2024-Pygame/tree/main/games/button-gambling)) After that first game I started to make another (much simpler) game, which used no sprites and only the default rendering shapes. In this game you click a button and theres a 50/50 chance of resetting your progress, the goal of the game is to click the button the most times without it reseting (The highest i've seen was 12 (1/4096 chance)), this code is sitting at only 88 lines of code as it was very simple to make.

([**Pizza Clicker**](https://github.com/my-dimons/Genius-Hour-2024-Pygame/tree/main/games/pizza-clicker)) For my third and final game I wanted to go all out, the idea was a cookie clicker-esque game but instead of cookies, its pizzas. This game was a final project to wrap up this genius hour in which it definitely did its job, as it's sitting at over **650 lines of code**.

1. Find the game you want to download. Click on the link below, then find the game you want to download and click its name (the .zip).
2. Download it. On the top right there are 3 buttons ("RAW", 2 squares overlapping, and a download button), click on "RAW" or the download button (Doesn't matter).
3. Un-zip it. Find the file in file explorer (In your downloads folder), right click the file you downloaded and click "Extract All". Click ok on the popup, then wait for it to extract.
4. Open it. Open the new file you extracted, then open on the .exe file inside of that new folder. Now wait for it to open.
